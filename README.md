* Do not zoom in too close while moving fast - motion sickness.
* Pan to the left/right after a short delay as player changes direction to give them more of the part of the screen they care about.
* Try to keep horizon fixed?
* While jumping: Eliminate vertical camera motion,
  * pan when player reaches higher platform
  * or put delayed spring on vertical camera panning.
* Add points of interest and favor panning towards those.
